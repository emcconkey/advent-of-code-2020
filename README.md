# Advent of Code 2020

## My Contribution for the Advent of Code 2020

Inputs are stored in the inputs directory. To run each day/part just run php <filename> from the command line.

Note on timing: I only start the timer after the input data is read in to focus on the algorithm execution time, not the file read/processing time.

## Results: php 8.0.0 on 2020 M1 macbook pro 13"
